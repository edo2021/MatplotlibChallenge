in this project 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. The task is to generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study and a top-level summary of the study results.
Before beginning the analysis, check the data for any mouse ID with duplicate time points and remove any data associated with that mouse ID.


Use the cleaned data for the remaining steps.


Generate a summary statistics table consisting of the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen.


Generate a bar plot using both Pandas's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot that shows the total number of measurements taken for each treatment regimen throughout the course of the study.
